## 5. Areas of Excellence

1. **Performance Optimization Strategy**
   - Sophisticated multi-layer caching
   - Intelligent request batching
   - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Memoization of expensive operations

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive validation
   - Error boundaries at multiple levels
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Type Safety**
   - Complete TypeScript coverage
   - Strict type checking
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - Type guards and assertions

4. **Architecture**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - SOLID principles adherence
   - Composition over inheritance
   - Service-oriented design

## 6. Identified Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues
1. **Console Warnings**: 400+ console.log statements need cleanup
   - **Fix**: Use proper logging service or remove debug statements

2. **React Hook Dependencies**: Some missing dependencies in useEffect
   - **Fix**: Add missing dependencies or use useCallback

3. **Large File Size**: costStore.ts is 1000+ lines
   - **Fix**: Split into smaller modules

### Recommendations
1. **Modularization**: Split costStore into smaller, focused modules
2. **Cache Coordination**: Implement centralized cache management
3. **Error Recovery**: Add automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
5. **Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring and analytics
