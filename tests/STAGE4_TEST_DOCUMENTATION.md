# Stage 4 Transcription Pipeline Integration Testing

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite validates the complete Universal Assistant transcription pipeline from audio capture through to UI display. The tests ensure that the recently fixed transcription system works correctly under various conditions and meets performance requirements.

## Architecture Under Test

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Failures

1. **Audio Permission Errors**:
   ```
   Solution: Ensure mock services are properly initialized
   Check: MediaDevices mock in test setup
   ```

2. **WebSocket Connection Failures**:
   ```
   Solution: Verify MockWebSocket implementation
   Check: Deepgram API response simulation
   ```

3. **Performance Test Failures**:
   ```
   Solution: Check system load during test execution
   Consider: Adjusting performance targets for test environment
   ```

### Browser Test Issues

1. **Playwright Installation**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **Permission Denied**:
   ```
   Solution: Tests automatically grant microphone permissions
   Check: Browser launch arguments in playwright.config.ts
   ```

3. **Timeout Issues**:
   ```
   Solution: Increase timeout values in test configuration
   Consider: Network latency in CI environments
   ```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Stage 4 Transcription Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  transcription-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-reports
          path: tests/reports/
```

### Performance Monitoring

Set up alerts for performance regressions:

```bash
# Extract performance metrics from test results
jq '.summary.performance' tests/reports/stage4/stage4-test-results.json

# Monitor key metrics over time
# - End-to-end latency trends
# - Memory usage patterns
# - Error rate changes
```

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. **Follow Naming Convention**: `stage4-[component]-[type].test.ts`
2. **Use Existing Mocks**: Extend current mock implementations
3. **Include Performance Metrics**: Add benchmarking where relevant
4. **Update Documentation**: Add test descriptions to this file

### Test Development Guidelines

- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and idempotent
- **Realistic Data**: Use representative test data and scenarios
- **Clear Assertions**: Write descriptive expect statements
- **Performance Aware**: Consider test execution time and resource usage
- **Error Scenarios**: Include both happy path and error cases

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Screenshot comparison for UI components
2. **Load Testing**: Stress testing with realistic concurrent user loads
3. **Network Simulation**: Testing under various network conditions
4. **Device Testing**: Mobile device and different browser engine testing
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation validation

### Monitoring Integration

- **Real-time Metrics**: Live performance dashboards
- **Alerting**: Automated notifications for test failures
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance tracking
- **Regression Detection**: Automated detection of performance degradation
