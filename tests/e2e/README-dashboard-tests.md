# Dashboard Tests Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive test suite for the Universal Assistant dashboard modifications.

## Overview

The dashboard has undergone significant modifications to remove scheduling features and integrate with real Firebase data. These tests ensure that all changes work correctly and don't introduce regressions.

## Dashboard Modifications Tested

### ✅ Removed Features
- **"Schedule Meeting" button** - Completely removed from Quick Actions
- **"Today's Schedule" section** - Entire section removed from dashboard
- **All scheduling-related UI** - No calendar widgets, schedule lists, or upcoming meeting displays

### ✅ Modified Features
- **Quick Actions** - Now contains only "Start New Meeting" button
- **Statistics Cards** - Now display real Firebase data instead of mock percentages
- **Navigation** - "Start New Meeting" navigates to `/meeting` page

### ✅ Maintained Features
- **Recent Meetings** - Continues to show user's meeting history
- **Statistics Display** - Total Meetings, Active Meetings, Total Hours, Participants
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Authentication** - Requires user authentication to access

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all dashboard tests
npm run test:dashboard

# Run only E2E tests
npm run test:dashboard:e2e

# Run E2E tests with browser visible
npm run test:dashboard:e2e:headed

# Run only unit/integration tests
npm run test:dashboard:unit
```

### Targeted Testing
```bash
# Test specific aspects
npm run test:dashboard:performance    # Performance tests
npm run test:dashboard:accessibility  # Accessibility tests
npm run test:dashboard:responsive     # Responsive design tests

# Run with specific Playwright options
npx playwright test tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts --project=chromium
npx playwright test tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts --headed --slowMo=1000
```

## Test Categories

### 1. UI Component Verification
- ✅ Verifies "Schedule Meeting" button is not present
- ✅ Verifies "Today's Schedule" section is not present
- ✅ Verifies only "Start New Meeting" button exists in Quick Actions
- ✅ Verifies all statistics cards are displayed properly
- ✅ Verifies Recent Meetings section is present

### 2. Navigation Tests
- ✅ Tests "Start New Meeting" button navigates to `/meeting`
- ✅ Tests back navigation works correctly
- ✅ Tests authentication state is preserved during navigation

### 3. Data Integration Tests
- ✅ Tests dashboard displays real Firebase data (not mock percentages)
- ✅ Tests loading states are displayed while data loads
- ✅ Tests error states are handled gracefully
- ✅ Tests statistics update when user data changes

### 4. Authentication Integration
- ✅ Tests dashboard requires authentication
- ✅ Tests unauthenticated users are redirected
- ✅ Tests authentication state persists across navigation

### 5. Responsive Design Tests
- ✅ Tests desktop layout (1440x900)
- ✅ Tests tablet layout (768x1024)
- ✅ Tests mobile layout (375x667)
- ✅ Tests card layouts remain proper after modifications

### 6. Accessibility Tests
- ✅ Tests proper heading hierarchy
- ✅ Tests button accessibility attributes
- ✅ Tests keyboard navigation
- ✅ Tests screen reader compatibility

### 7. Performance Tests
- ✅ Tests dashboard loads within reasonable time (<5 seconds)
- ✅ Tests no console errors on dashboard load
- ✅ Tests no memory leaks from removed components

## Page Object Model

The `DashboardPage` class provides reusable methods for interacting with dashboard elements:

```typescript
// Example usage
const dashboardPage = new DashboardPage(page);
await dashboardPage.goto();
await dashboardPage.waitForDashboardLoad();
await dashboardPage.verifySchedulingFeaturesRemoved();
await dashboardPage.startNewMeeting();
```

### Key Methods
- `goto()` - Navigate to dashboard
- `waitForDashboardLoad()` - Wait for page to fully load
- `verifySchedulingFeaturesRemoved()` - Check removed features
- `verifyQuickActionsStructure()` - Verify Quick Actions section
- `verifyStatisticsCards()` - Check statistics display
- `startNewMeeting()` - Click Start New Meeting button

## Test Configuration

The `dashboard-test.config.ts` file provides:
- **Viewport configurations** for responsive testing
- **Mock data** for consistent testing
- **Test utilities** for common operations
- **Selectors** for dashboard elements
- **Assertion helpers** for complex verifications

## Expected Test Results

### Passing Criteria
All tests should pass, indicating:
- ✅ Scheduling features completely removed
- ✅ Quick Actions contains only "Start New Meeting"
- ✅ Real Firebase data integration working
- ✅ Navigation to meeting page works
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ Accessibility standards met
- ✅ Performance within acceptable limits

### Common Issues
If tests fail, check:
- 🔍 Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- 🔍 Firebase connection and authentication
- 🔍 Browser permissions for Playwright
- 🔍 Recent code changes affecting dashboard structure

## Test Reports

Test results are saved to:
- **HTML Report**: `tests/reports/playwright/index.html`
- **JSON Report**: `tests/reports/dashboard-test-report.json`
- **Screenshots**: Captured on test failures
- **Videos**: Recorded for failed tests

## Debugging Tests

### Debug Individual Tests
```bash
# Run with browser visible
npx playwright test tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts --headed --slowMo=1000

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts -g "should not display Schedule Meeting button"

# Debug mode
npx playwright test tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts --debug
```

### Debug Test Runner
```bash
# Run test runner with verbose output
npm run test:dashboard 2>&1 | tee dashboard-test-log.txt
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI environments:
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 2 retries on failure
- **Parallel**: Tests run in parallel when possible
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure for debugging

## Contributing

When modifying dashboard tests:
1. Update page object model if elements change
2. Add new test cases for new features
3. Update selectors in test configuration
4. Ensure tests are deterministic and don't rely on external state
5. Add appropriate wait conditions for dynamic content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

**Test fails with "Element not found"**
- Check if element selectors have changed
- Verify page is fully loaded before assertions
- Update page object model selectors

**Authentication issues**
- Ensure test environment has valid Firebase config
- Check if authentication state is properly mocked
- Verify user permissions for dashboard access

**Performance test failures**
- Check network conditions
- Verify development server performance
- Adjust timeout values if needed

**Responsive design issues**
- Verify viewport sizes are set correctly
- Check CSS media queries
- Test on actual devices if needed
