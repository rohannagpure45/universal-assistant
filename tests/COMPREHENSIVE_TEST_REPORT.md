   ```javascript
   // Add rules for transcript entries collection
   match /transcripts/{meetingId}/entries/{entryId} {
     allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Test Users**
   - Create dedicated test user accounts in Firebase Auth
   - Set up test data for automated testing scenarios

### Performance Optimizations

3. **Implement Error Boundaries**
   - Add React error boundaries for Firebase permission errors
   - Implement graceful degradation for real-time features

4. **Enhance Authentication Flow**
   - Consider redirect flow instead of popup to avoid COOP warnings
   - Add loading states for authentication transitions

### Testing Enhancements

5. **Expand E2E Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for audio recording functionality
   - Test real-time transcription with proper permissions
   - Implement cross-browser compatibility tests

6. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement client-side performance tracking
   - Add error tracking and reporting
   - Monitor Firebase usage and quotas
